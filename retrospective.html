  <h1>Retrospective & Business Impact</h1>

  <h2>What Went Well</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Early alignment on KPIs reduced confusion and prevented rework later in the project</li>
    <li>Regular stakeholder check-ins kept expectations clear and helped resolve blockers quickly</li>
    <li>Delivering an MVP enabled an on-time launch and created a foundation for iteration</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Didn’t Go Well</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Some metric definitions required additional clarification later than expected</li>
    <li>The tight timeline limited time for exploring advanced dashboard features</li>
    <li>Feedback cycles occasionally slowed due to competing stakeholder priorities</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I’d Do Differently</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Schedule a dedicated KPI alignment session earlier to finalize definitions faster</li>
    <li>Run lightweight usability testing before stakeholder review to improve clarity</li>
    <li>Build additional buffer time for iteration and last-minute feedback</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Business Impact Summary</h2>
  <div class="impact">
    <p>
      The internal marketing analytics dashboard provided stakeholders with a centralized, reliable view
      of campaign performance, improving visibility and enabling faster decision-making. Consolidating
      key metrics reduced time spent on manual reporting and helped align the team around consistent KPI
      definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      By prioritizing a focused MVP under tight constraints, the project delivered value quickly while
      setting the foundation for future enhancements based on stakeholder feedback and adoption trends.
